*What do you think when someone says, programming?*

- I'm not good at computers.
- It's hard.
- Usually reserved for computer science majors.

What if I told you that those are all misconceptions. And that programming is easy and that anyone can do it?

Think about everything you've done in your life. How did you begin to even understand how to do _this thing you're good at_?

There's a starting point for everything, and this is what I hope this course can be for you. I'm self-taught, I had help early on but I have taught myself everything I know.

And I'm here to tell you, that you can too. It won't be quick, it will take time, and at times, will feel like hell. But the more you learn, the more you understand, the better and easier it gets.

JavaScript is just one of many programming languages out there. Today we will try to break down how the language works into small bits, we won't get through everything, but that's okay, we will just work on getting through as much as we can.

*Any questions before we begin?*

OK, so let's talk about how human communication works. The basic sentence is a set of directives really. Think about it, verbs are actions, nouns are descriptions, periods are terminators.

The programming languages by the very nature of human communication, have been designed to work in a similar manner because that's how we think. We instruct each other via these statements.

So let's think about how JavaScript works.

JavaScript at the very base level is a set of instructions using a particular syntax and grammar.

Here is an example of a statement in JavaScript.

<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@erikreyna/js-001?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

We'll get into what this all means in a second but what we are basically saying here is, hey, take this number, 42, and assign it to a variable called meaningOfLife.

We then print out (log) a phrase with that variable into the console.
