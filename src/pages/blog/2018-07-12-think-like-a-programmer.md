## Introduction

When someone talks about programming or coding, it's easy to imagine it's all this:

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:44%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/A06UFEx8jxEwU" width="100%" height=100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

It looks frightening and overwhelming. But I'm here to say **DO NOT PANIC!**

This looks way more terrifying than it actually is.

The truth is you probably already can think like a programmer and probably don't even realize it.



![You're a Programmer and you didn't know it](/files/programmer.jpg)

Simply put, programming, or **writing code**, is how you tell a computer to perform a certain action-- like an instruction manual.

Computers are like very good doggies (after going graduating from obedience school, of course!).

They'll listen and follow your every commands, but only exactly what you tell it to do. If you don't tell them to roll over, they won't roll over. :(

A **programming language** is a language which the computer understands. The problem is that computers don't really understand human language. If we tell the computer:

Nothing will happen. In fact, the computer will give you an error telling you that it did not understand the command. However, if we use a programming language called python to tell it to do the exact same thing:

<iframe height="300px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@CarlaAstudillo/printsamplecorrect?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

And there you go! We have programmed. 

Each programming language has its own **syntax** which is the set of rules on how the language should be structure based on what the computer expects it to be. This can include the spelling and grammar of the language (which is why good copy editors make good programmers). The good news is that many programming languages share similar syntax rules.

However, computers are inflexible because they're binary. They either work or they don't. When the computer is not doing what you want it to do, there's probably an error in how you wrote the code. That's where **testing** and **debugging** comes in that helps you **trace** the problem so you can find a solution.

## Figuring out how to go from human language to computer language

Let's write a recipe for arroz con pollo.

**Class Assignment:** We're going to write down specific instructions on how to cook arroz con pollo.

Now that we've written our recipe, let's identify the following things:

* A simple command: Do something
* We declare/define/label an item: This is a something.
* A conditional command: If something happens, then do something. If not, do something else
* A repeated command: Keep doing something until something else happens

You're thinking like a computer now!

## Simple programming concepts (that you've just written!)

### Statements

They are a directive to a computer program acting as an interpreter of some kind, in order to perform a specific task.

> **Add Olive Oil in to a cooking pan.**

### Declarations

Determines the name and data type of a variable that you are defining 

> **The boiling point of the water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit**

### Logical Operators

Symbols that tells the program to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result. May return a boolean data type of true or false. Examples: AND, OR, GREATER THAN, LESS THAN, EQUAL TO

> **Add more than two teaspoons of salt and more than or equal to five teaspoons of paprika to rice.**

Note: In Javascript below, AND is denoted by "&&", OR is denoted by "||", greater than is denoted by ">"

### Conditional Statements

A set of statements performed if a certain condition is met. 

**When water reaches boiling point, add rice to pot**

### Functions

These are sections of code which you can call to perform certain actions. Can include parameters.

> **Chop garlic and onion into seven pieces**

### Loops

A sequence that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. 

> **Stir in onions, garlic, salt, rice and paprika in pot**
